Then on landing page will be Type a provider chose your location and date 

Then you must add the filters such as budget (Min spend) ,price clear and Apply, Most popular sort by most popular, price low to high, Dual expertise, emergency support , years of experience , numbers of bookings, price high to low, closest to me, 24/7 availability , highest rated and then put Clear and Apply 

Then will be the profiles of the Providers with the picture, the heart on the top right on their profile so the client can save , Verified badge , the other icon of share as client might want to share that provider with others , also their location, services and money , the reviews , and how many people booked with them and a short intro .

When people click on that profile will be a deep intro with followings :

-	ON THE LEFT SIDE u will see 
Profile , name, location, services and money they charge , verified badge V, and how many people booked with them and also badges moving like this website( look on the right side next to the profile ) : https://topmate.io/anubhav_ritolia?utm_content=ai_search_27892&utm_source=landing_page_hero&utm_medium=hito&utm_term=hito_landing

And then the provider will be having :About them which they mentioned when they joined , their expertise , What they can offer , their experience, Reviews , Help about support and then the bottom of page with legals etc 

On the right side like fiver have it will be :How many people looking to book the way www.YumMatch.com has, share button the way fiver has and Report button the way fiver has and then will be 4  small boxes with : face to face and the price , Video consultation and price , Location and Date  and then Buy option , and then Contact the Provider 

So when client has not booked yet the provider but used the Contact provider chat the client should not be able or allowed to text phone number, email   or social media like fiver has . however after the client booked the attach option and emoji must be available for the client and the provider but again not text phone number, email   or social media only live tracking to be on from provider before the appointment 



 




And then payments like stripe, paypal, credit card and debit card  and  klarna pay later .So website must automatically take 26% from provider and 6% from the client from the total amount so lets say £100 the provider charges so website take 26% commission so will be £26 for website and provider will get £74 in 2-5 workings days and website must add 6% to client fee charged to the client which will be taken from the website which is £6 .Will be this for all payments regardless of the amount the percentage which the website take must be 26% and 6% 

Last and not Least you must  : add  logos from figma for example : Failed to load rooms due to timeout , Please check your internet connection and try again.
